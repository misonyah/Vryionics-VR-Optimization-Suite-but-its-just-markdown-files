        explanation: {
          simple: 'VRChat\'s per-avatar PhysBones cap is set to unlimited in your config.json. In a world with 20+ players (each with hair, tails, clothes simulating), this is the single biggest reason VR users get CPU-bound and hit reprojection.',
          advanced: 'The config key here is `dynamic_bone_max_affected_transform_count` — the name is legacy from when VRChat used the Dynamic Bone Unity asset. Since 2022 those components are auto-converted to VRChat\'s in-house PhysBones system, but the config key still controls the per-avatar transform-simulation cap. `0` means no cap. Avatars routinely ship with 100–500 simulating bones; at 20 players that\'s 10k+ transforms per frame at 90Hz. Capping at 32 per avatar cuts main-thread CPU 60–80% in populated worlds with very little visual difference. The in-game equivalent is Settings → Performance Options → Avatar Performance Limiter, which overrides config.json when set.'

          advanced: `dynamic_bone_max_affected_transform_count = ${affected} (the legacy key name — it now controls PhysBones simulation since VRChat auto-converted the old Dynamic Bone components in 2022). Cost scales linearly with cap × player count. 20 players × ${affected} = ${affected * 20} transforms/frame. 32–64 is the sweet spot for VR's frame budget.`

        explanation: {
          simple: 'Collider checks per bone are uncapped. PhysBone colliders are what let hair/cloth bump against an avatar\'s body — they work, but they\'re expensive, and an uncapped count is a recipe for frame-time spikes around complex avatars.',
          advanced: 'dynamic_bone_max_collider_check_count = 0 means no limit on collider-bone intersection tests per frame. Each test is roughly O(transforms × colliders). Avatars with full-body collision meshes can generate thousands of tests per frame. Capping at 8 eliminates the worst-case spike while keeping physics looking right. The key name is legacy from the old Dynamic Bone asset — it now governs PhysBone collider checks.'

          advanced: 'config.json controls a handful of things VRChat doesn\'t expose in the in-game settings menu — avatar culling distance, the per-avatar PhysBones simulation/collider caps (still keyed under the legacy `dynamic_bone_max_*` names), cache size, particle limits. Without it, VRChat ships with values that prioritise looking-correct over performing-well in social instances. Applying the recommended config gives you immediate breathing room in anything 5+ players.'

        explanation: {
          simple: `VRChat is using ${msaa}x MSAA. In VR this is extremely expensive — you're rendering each pixel ${msaa} times for anti-aliasing. In VR, temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) at 1x MSAA provides better image quality at much lower GPU cost.`,
          advanced: `MSAA ${msaa}x multiplies the render target size by ${msaa} for color and depth buffers. At VR resolution (~2160×2160 per eye for most headsets), ${msaa}x MSAA requires ${msaa}× the fill-rate and VRAM bandwidth. MSAA was designed for rasterized forward rendering; VR deferred rendering with VRChat's lighting makes MSAA ${msaa}x disproportionately expensive. Setting to 1x with sharpening enabled via SteamVR or your headset's upscaling produces better perceived quality with 50-75% less GPU cost.`

A 20GB cache holds ~50-100 frequently-visited avatar/world bundles.

At ${mirrorRes}px, this is effectively doubling GPU workload whenever a mirror is in view. Setting mirror resolution to 256-512px is invisible in VR (your headset resolution limits how much detail you can actually see in a mirror) but cuts mirror rendering cost by 75-90%.`
